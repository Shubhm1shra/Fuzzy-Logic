# Fuzzy-Logic
Welcome to my implementation of Fuzzy-Logic, implemented by taking a basic example of calulating the probability of Fan-speed being low, medium or high on the basis of current temperature and humidity as provided by user.Fuzzy logic allows you to model complex relationships, make decisions in ambiguous environments, and create intelligent systems that mimic human-like reasoning.

## Logic üß†
Understand the foundational logic behind fuzzy sets, where uncertainty is embraced, and imprecision becomes a strength. Explore the nuanced roles of key components:

### Membership Functions :
Membership functions define the degree of membership of a value in a fuzzy set. These functions play a crucial role in translating real-world, continuous variables into fuzzy linguistic terms. Whether it's representing 'low,' 'medium,' or 'high' temperature, membership functions capture the essence of imprecise information.

### Inference System : 
Inference engines interpret fuzzy rules to derive meaningful conclusions. Whether using the classic Mamdani method or the more concise Sugeno approach, inference engines play a vital role in decision-making by processing fuzzy input and generating fuzzy output.

### Defuzzification : 
Defuzzification bridges the gap between fuzzy and crisp logic. By converting fuzzy output into a precise value, defuzzification allows for actionable decision-making. Explore methods like centroid, mean of maximum, and weighted average, each offering a unique perspective on extracting crisp information from fuzzy results.

### Rule-based Systems : 
At the core of fuzzy logic are rule-based systems. These systems articulate relationships between input and output variables using linguistic rules. Easily define and manipulate these rules to create sophisticated models that capture the intricacies of real-world scenarios.
